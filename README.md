# Common-Libraries
To hold common library functions that will be dependencies for other projects

## How to use it

```
./compile.sh examples/reverse_linkedlist.cpp
./practice.out
```

And the output will be: 
```
Original linked-list: 1 2 3 4 5
Modified linked-list: 5 4 3 2 1
```

Similarly this can be done for building trees or doubly-linkedlist

## TODO

* add an example file where user passes in a vector and builds a tree, or see `tree.h`
* add an example file where user passes in a vector and builds a doubly-linked-list, or see `tree.h`
* add tons of examples where user uses various file reading techniques for IO (see File-Reader repo) or see `io.h`
